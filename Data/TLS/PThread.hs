-- | An implementation of TLS using the standard, Posix
-- `pthread_create_key` routine.
--
-- Note that because this implementation uses Posix threads, it does
-- NOT care about Haskell IO threads.  This module is generally used
-- to avoid problems with data structures or other APIs that are not
-- thread safe.  That is, pthread-based TLS is sufficient to disallow
-- simultaneous access, irrespective of where IO threads migrate to.
